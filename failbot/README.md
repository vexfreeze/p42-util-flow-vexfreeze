Known issues:
- Not tested this on 0 engines aircraft as I couldn't find one
- Fuel off does not work on jets
- No event to auto start/stop specific engine so it starts/stops all at the moment
- Not thoroughly tested so something may pop up

To do:
- React on channel points redemptions
- Restrict certain commands to Mods/VIPs/etc.
- Commands configurable to be on message or redemption
- Add more failures!
