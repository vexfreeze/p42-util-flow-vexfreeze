# Description

Use !route command in twitch chat to show latest SimBrief Route

RouteBot checks simbrief for new route
* on flight start
* when refresh button is clicked
* on !route command but in this case at most once per minute

Navigraph confirmed that api endpoint is not intended for polling, hence no automatic route updates until ther is a viable solution
